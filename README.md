## Investigating Factors Influencing Salaries of Data Science Roles

### Overview
This project explores various factors impacting salaries in the data science domain, such as experience, education, geographic location, and industry sector. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that can help understand what influences data science salaries globally.

### Prerequisites

```
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- R and RStudio
- Required R packages: tidyverse and ggplot2
```

You can install these packages using R commands like:
```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(GGally)
library(parsnip)
library(broom)
```

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using the terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KerenOmari-Baah/Data-science-roles.git
cd datascience-science-roles-r
```

### Data
The observational unit in this dataset is a job posting from the ai-jobs.net website. The dataset comprises a total of 3755 stings. There are 11 variables in total. The response variable we focused on is the salary of each job posting, measured in US dollars and it is named salary_in_usd in the dataset. The data preprocessing steps involved:
- Cleaning
- Feature engineering
  

### Analysis
For the analysis these methods were employed:
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Predictive modeling

### Usage
Guide users through running the analysis:
1. Open RStudio and set the project directory as your working directory.
2. Load the quarto file.
3. Execute the markdown files to reproduce the analysis and results.
